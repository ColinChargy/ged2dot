= ged2dot, a GEDCOM to Graphviz converter

== What's the problem the tool solves?

`ged2dot` is a script that takes a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM[GEDCOM]
file and tries to visualize it using http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz]'s `dot`
tool. The basic idea is that you can map individuals to graph nodes and
families to graph edges, then `dot` takes care of the rest. What's unique about
`ged2dot` is that it allows more than showing ancestors and descendants of a
single individual (what you can easily do with random family editor software).

== Scenarios

Currently it allows to show ancestors of a family (both husband and wife), and
you can set how many generations do you want to see, and also for how many
generations you want to include sibling families as well:

(But the tool can be easily extended to support other scenarios as well.)

== LibreOffice Draw GEDCOM import filter

The `libreoffice/` subdirectory contains a LibreOffice extension, that
implements a GEDCOM import filter for Draw. Needless to say, it uses `ged2dot`
internally. :-)

Its dependencies:

- It uses Graphviz to transfer the `dot` format into SVG. In case
you don't have Graphviz installed:

  * For Windows, http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php[get it here] (2.34 is tested).

  * For Linux, use your package manager to install the `graphviz` package (2.28 is tested).

- We depend on LibreOffice >= 4.2 RC1 because
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39206[fdo#39206] is not fixed in
  earlier versions.

Once that's done, you'll see something like this if you open a GEDCOM file:

== Bugs

For `ged2dot`, in case a given input results in a runtime crash, please open
https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/issues/new[a new issue] on GitHub, including
an URL to your input.

For the LibreOffice extension, in case you get an error during opening:

- For Windows, the log file location is something like:

----
C:/Users/John/Application Data/LibreOffice/4/user/Scripts/python/log.txt
----

- For Linux, start LibreOffice from a terminal, the log is printed to the
  standard error.

In both cases, please open a new issue, including the log contents in addition
to the input.

== Icons

Icons are from

in case placeholders have to be used for missing images.
